## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Dark grey (#121212) to create a modern, sleek dark theme, aligning with Nirlaba-style dashboards. The hue has been kept in line with the primary color at a low saturation.
- Primary color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF) to provide a vibrant and engaging feel for key elements, while remaining readable and high contrast on the dark background.
- Accent color: Cyan (#00FFFF) for interactive elements and highlights, analogous to the primary but with altered saturation for maximum contrast.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif, for both headings and body text, to provide a modern, clean and readable interface, prioritizing clarity and consistency.
- Use minimalist icons in a linear style, colored with the accent color, to represent different sections and actions, ensuring clarity without visual clutter.
- Employ a responsive grid layout to ensure optimal viewing and functionality across various screen sizes, maintaining a consistent look and feel.
- Subtle, fast animations (e.g., fade-in, slide-in) for transitions and data updates, enhancing user experience without being distracting.
